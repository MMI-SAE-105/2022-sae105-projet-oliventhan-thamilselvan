                <h1 class="h1_article">Public Enemy’s 1990 song “Fight The Power”</h1>
                <h2 class="h3_article">"Fight the power" is a song made by the American band Public Enemy in 1989. This song was originally written for the movie Do The Right Thing by Spike Lee but the band integrated it later by modifying it in the album Fear of a black planet which was released in April 1990. This song is a great success from its release and receives several awards. The song gets its place in several rankings of best songs of all time.

                </h1>
                <h2 class="h3_article">The success of this song can be justified by the context of the time. Black Americans had finally obtained laws where they were not discriminated against after years and years of suffering. The government was forced to end segregation in the 1960's after several events and demonstrations throughout the country for decades. The United States saw a gradual abolition of segregation with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Civil Rights Act of 1968, etc... But it still took years and several court cases to enforce the end of segregation. During the release of this song, there were still many racist and discriminatory acts in the country and this song revolutionized the politicized youth of the time and brought back the revolutionary anger of discriminated Americans in the music industry.

                <h1 class="h2_article">Why “Fight the power”?</h1>
                <h2 class="h3_article">The term "Fight The Power" is repeated several times throughout the song. The chorus is practically just a repetition of "Fight The Power". This term means to fight the power in English. The power in this case represents the government and the band is telling the people to revolt against the government to get their rights.  This song is an international success because everyone who was discriminated against could relativize themselves with this song.

                <h2 class="h3_article">The lyrics can be put into perspective with the situation in Sri Lanka since the last century. The Tamils, mostly of Hindu religion, were discriminated against to varying degrees by the Sinhalese, mostly of Buddhist religion. Several people tried to fight against these discriminations without violence but ended up being humiliated or even killed by the authorities. This led to several secessionist movements, notably the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which fought against the Sri Lankan government for almost three decades and finally lost in 2009 because of several non-humanitarian acts by the Sri Lankan government.
