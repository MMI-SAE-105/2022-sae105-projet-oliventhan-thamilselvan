                <h2 class="h3_article">Sri Lanka is an island country in the Indian Ocean off the southern end of the subcontinent of India. It's considered to be a devoutly religious country with a rich culture. The name 'Sri Lanka' translates to 'saintly land,' suggesting that the land has a spiritual significance as well as an everyday relevance. In addition, the name is derived from Sri, which means 'holy' or 'sacred,' and Lanka, which means 'lion.' Taken together, these factors indicate that the country was named after lions- perhaps because of its lion-like physique or because lions symbolize strength and majesty.

                <h2 class="h3_article">Sri Lanka is known for its natural beauty and history. The country is home to many ancient cities, including Kaviratissa Nag temple and Anuradha Pethya Siva temple at Polonnawaththa. It also has many ancient Buddhist monuments like Sigiriya and Templehencthenan monetized with gold. Henry Pottington also included Sigiriya in his 2017 book 100 Must See Destinations Around The World. Sigiriya is one of the world's greatest stone buildings. It stands over 100 feet tall and has 88 steps to the top. In addition, Sri Lanka is known for its tradition of sacred dance, which dates back thousands of years. The dances were originally used for religious purposes but have since become a national tradition.

                <h1 class="h2_article">A country of inequalities</h1>
                <h2 class="h3_article">The country has been promoting civil liberties by protesting against oppression since the 18th century. The first major protest in Sri Lanka took place in 1789 against British rule on the island nation of Ceylon. This was followed by a series of protests against oppressive rulers such as Mahinda Rajapaksa in the 20th century. These protests led to a Tamil rebellion that eventually freed Sri Lanka from oppressive rulers in the 18th century- paving the way for later democratic reforms by leaders such as Jaffna Manel Jayawardene and Dudley Senawgson Mendis.

                <h1 class="h2_article">An unstable situation</h1>
                <h2 class="h3_article">Sri Lanka is currently experiencing a democratic resurgence after a long period of civil unrest. Its last major war took place in 2009 under former leader Mahinda Rajapaksa. In addition, another war between this country and its neighboring country, India, began in 1983 and continues today. Both countries are striving to gain territory and establish political control over their respective areas. While there's still room for improvement, Sri Lankan citizens are making great strides toward creating a fair and democratic country system.

                <h2 class="h3_article">On a global scale, Sri Lanka is making significant progress toward creating an open and free society that respects human rights- including civil liberties, democracy and freedom of religion. Their culture promotes civil liberties, promotes freedom of religion and promotes freedom from oppression through protests against oppressive rulers. Their history makes it clear that this country has enjoyed great success in creating a free society over the past decade- but it isn't perfect yet either.
